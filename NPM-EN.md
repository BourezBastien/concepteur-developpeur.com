NPM is an manager for Node Packages, used to publish packages and therefore share packages with other developpers using NPM<br>
NPM is divided by 3 axes.

1. NPM Website
    
    The [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) website is a usefull resource to see which packages are availables on the NPM Registry

2. CLI or Command Line Interface

    CLI's a very large part of NPM, because it's with CLI that you'll interact with NPM Registry.<br>
    You're able to download NPM packages from CLI, send yours, execute downloaded packages, so, it's a realy big part
    of NPM.

3. NPM Registry

    Registry is a huge database containing JS Packages, Registry can contain some JS applications or just some other packages
    That you'll be able to manage, adapt at your needs and so use in your own project.<br>
    But like it was said above, you can also get JS applications ready to use therefore, you can get applications and execute it
